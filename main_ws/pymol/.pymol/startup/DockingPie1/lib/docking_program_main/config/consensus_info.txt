WHAT IS A CONSENSUS SCORING ANALYSIS?

A rescoring method


WHICH ARE THE PURPOSES OF THIS METHOD?

To combine the results of different scoring functions.
Such combination of Scoring Function is aimed to have a much more accurate ranking of the predicted bio-active molecules.


WHICH ARE THE STEPS TO PERFORM SUCH ANALYSIS?

- Run Dockings on the same system with different Docking programs
- Compare the poses of a Docking Run with the poses of the other Docking Run
- Compute the RMSD for each comparison
- Define a threshold of RMSD under which the two compared poses are defined as being 'in consensus'
